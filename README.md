> ##### PhysioNet 2023 entry for Team Swarthbeat. This repo contains code for our ML ensemble tree model combining MATLAB's TreeBagger, AdaBoost, and RUSBoost along with a primary focus in expert-based feature extraction from a signal processing POV. Compared to the final entry, this entry experiments with graph-based reduction, PCA on correlated features, and scalogram analyses to minimize overfitting caused by the feature set.
